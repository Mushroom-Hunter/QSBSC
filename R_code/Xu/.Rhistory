# row names are genes

# generate a plot to visualize some of the data
plot(umi_sum, read_sum, main='GitHub data')
# now, pull data from local repository
# note: ".." represents going up one directory from the current working directory
# this code should work if the current working directory in R (or R-Studio) is the directory
# containing this file; check by typing "getwd()"
# the normalizePath() function should fix the path formatting for your computer
# WINDOWS users, especially: you should definitely learn this function since file paths
# are often not generalized for different computers
# you can add this function into code as needed
uc <- read.table(normalizePath('../../Data/tung/molecules.txt'), sep='\t')
rc <- read.table(normalizePath('../../Data/tung/reads.txt'), sep='\t')
# generate an output file (this demonstrates you have been able to load both data sets)
write.csv(data.frame(pulled_all_data=all(umi_counts==uc)),file='MyDataLoadTest.csv',row.names=FALSE)
# Homework:
# 1) make your own directory in the R_code folder (use your last name)
# 2) duplicate this file into your directory
# 3) execute the code and generate the test file that demonstrates you successfully loaded
#    all dta
# 4) commit your changes to the QSBSS GitHub repo
